Principles: RISC-V follows a load/store architecture, meaning all operations are performed on registers, and memory is accessed only through explicit load and store instructions.

Trade-offs:
	- Pros: Simplifies the instruction set, leading to easier decoding and potentially faster execution. It also allows for more efficient pipelining and parallelism.
	- Cons: Can increase the number of instructions needed for certain tasks, potentially leading to larger code size and more memory accesses.

- Open standard: RISC-V is open-source, which means there are no licensing fees. This reduces costs and encourages innovation, allowing custom modifications to the ISA to fit specific needs.
- Simplicity and modularity: The RISC-V instruction set is designed to be simple and modular, which makes it easier to implement in hardware
- Customizability: RISC-Vâ€™s extensibility allows you to add or remove features as needed, optimizing for power consumption, performance, or size, making it highly suitable for the specific constraints of IoT devices.
